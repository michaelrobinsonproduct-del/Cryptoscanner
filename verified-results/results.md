- Matured sampled outcomes across 1/6/24/48h: 2688; gap abstentions: 8124. Per-horizon counts require independent audit; do not infer held-out lift.
- Observed +30% hits: 0 (sampled only; not a success-rate estimate).
- False positives / missed movers: NOT VERIFIED without eligible continuous outcome coverage.
- Baseline vs challenger: recorded as-of; unbiased held-out lift NOT MEASURED.
